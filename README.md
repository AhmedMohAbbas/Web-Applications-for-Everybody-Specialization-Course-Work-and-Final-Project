# Web-Applications-for-Everybody-Specialization-Course-Work-Final-Project
The "Web Applications for Everybody Specialization" certificate is offered on Coursera by the University of Michigan. It is rewarded for those who successfully pass all the tests for the four courses of the Specialization.It is a great course which you can find here: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-applications

# This Repository
This repository contains my own personal coursework throughout the whole Specialization. It starts small and adds up progressively to the final project which is a complete (back-end wise) CRUD web application. Therefore, there will be some code snippets carried over here and there. As well as some personal notes and sketches, feel free to ignore those :)

Some files may contain code from examples as well as some trial and error and are not 100% my own code (examples, obviously) but could be useful to look at for a new learner. However, Any “Assignment” code is my own personally written code which I used to pass the course tests. At the Time of me taking this course, PHP version 7.4.1 was the one being used in the course material and in the course tests. Feel free to use any of this code as you wish.

The “CRUD Assignment” directory contains the final CRUD project. Which is a web app that tracks automobile data per user. A user can view all entries but can only manipulate the data entered by himself. This is the overarching example that most of the course material builds up to.

However, the final course uses different CRUD examples to introduce JavaScript/JQuery parts of the specialization. A part of the of the CRUD code here has been already given to focus on the interactive front end elements using JavaScript & JQuery.

 
 # About The Specialization
This Specialization is an introduction to building web applications for anybody who already has a basic understanding of responsive web design with JavaScript,  HTML, and CSS. It is an introduction to web application development. Students will develop web and database applications in PHP, using SQL for database creation, as well as functionality in JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON.
 
Over the course of this Specialization, you will create several web apps to add to your developer portfolio. This Specialization (and its prerequisites) will prepare you, even if you have little to no experience in programming or technology, for entry level web developer jobs in PHP. A student should, by the end of the course, demonstrate basic concepts, like database design, while working on assignments that require the development of increasingly challenging web apps. In addition to understanding how a web browser interacts with a web server to handle events with JQuery, you’ll gain a complete introductory overview of web application development.

While the courses do touch on, and involve, Front-End web development subjects. It is heavily geared towards the Back-End portion. HTML, CSS and bootstrap are here to serve their functional purpose and by no means are the end goal. For that I personally advice You take a dedicated Front-End course.
